# SpendLess
The goal of this project is to make a Progressive Web App (using Gatsby) to encourage the user to spend less when out and about. 

Why?
I'm very budget-conscions and while I don't use a budgeting app (I have my own reconciliation process that I do monthly which is 
quite extensive), I do keep track in my head when I've spent less than I've allotted or when I get a good deal, when I find a 
great item at thrift stores, etc. 

I know the psychology is there to prove if you want to really make a change with your behavior, you have to focus on it and (for
me at least) look at it as often as possible (so, in reality, it could be multiple times a day). If I can have an app that will
total up my day's "savings" in my mental budget keeping, I can feel reallly good about the progress I'm making to spend
more mindfully and in line with my family's budget goals.
